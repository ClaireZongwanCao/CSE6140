README

================================================================================

The codes has 4 python files (for 4 methods: branch and bound, 

approximation, and 2 local search algorithms) and 1 main init.py

file to control which algorithm to run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to run the code, change the parameter in the init.py file:

First parameter: name of input file, without .graph extension

Second parameter: cut-off time, in second

Third parameter: algorithm will be used to run, it could be "Approx"

for approximation, "BnB" for branch and bound, "LS1" or "LS2" for 

the 2 Local Search algorithms.

Fourth parameter: random seed. To help generate pseudorandom numbers,

for approximation algorithm and Local Search algorithm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once, you have set all the parameters, put the init.py file inside the same

folder that contains .graph input files and run it either using IDE or terminal

by typing: python init.py
